# Security Framework Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the security measures, protocols, and best practices implemented in the Smart Education ERP System.

## Authentication & Authorization

### JWT Implementation
- Token Structure:
  ```json
  {
    "header": {
      "alg": "HS256",
      "typ": "JWT"
    },
    "payload": {
      "sub": "user_id",
      "role": "user_role",
      "permissions": ["permission1", "permission2"],
      "iat": "issued_at",
      "exp": "expiration_time"
    }
  }
  ```
- Token Expiration:
  - Access Token: 24 hours
  - Refresh Token: 30 days
  - Password Reset Token: 1 hour

### Password Security
- Minimum 12 characters
- Must include:
  - Uppercase letters
  - Lowercase letters
  - Numbers
  - Special characters
- Password hashing using bcrypt
- Password history (last 5 passwords)
- Account lockout after 5 failed attempts
- Password change required every 90 days

## Data Protection

### Encryption
- Data at Rest:
  - AES-256 encryption for sensitive data
  - Encrypted database fields
  - Secure key management
- Data in Transit:
  - TLS 1.3 for all communications
  - Perfect Forward Secrecy
  - HSTS implementation

### Data Classification
1. **Public Data**
   - Course descriptions
   - Public announcements
   - General information

2. **Internal Data**
   - Student records
   - Teacher information
   - Course materials

3. **Confidential Data**
   - Assessment results
   - Personal information
   - Financial records

4. **Restricted Data**
   - System credentials
   - API keys
   - Security logs

## Access Control

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Predefined roles:
  - Super Admin
  - Admin
  - Teacher
  - Student
  - Parent
  - Staff
- Custom roles support
- Permission inheritance
- Time-based access restrictions

### IP Whitelisting
- Admin access restricted to specific IP ranges
- VPN requirement for remote access
- Geo-fencing for sensitive operations

## Security Monitoring

### Logging
- Authentication attempts
- Permission changes
- Data access
- System changes
- Error events
- Security incidents

### Alerting
- Real-time alerts for:
  - Multiple failed login attempts
  - Unusual access patterns
  - Security policy violations
  - System vulnerabilities
  - Data breaches

## Compliance

### GDPR Compliance
- Data minimization
- Right to be forgotten
- Data portability
- Privacy by design
- Data protection impact assessments
- Data processing agreements

### FERPA Compliance
- Student record protection
- Parent access rights
- Educational record management
- Directory information policies

## Incident Response

### Incident Classification
1. **Critical**
   - Data breach
   - System compromise
   - Unauthorized access

2. **High**
   - Multiple failed logins
   - Unusual activity
   - Policy violations

3. **Medium**
   - Single failed login
   - Minor policy violations
   - System warnings

4. **Low**
   - Informational events
   - Routine security checks

### Response Procedures
1. Detection
2. Assessment
3. Containment
4. Eradication
5. Recovery
6. Lessons Learned

## Security Testing

### Regular Testing
- Penetration testing (quarterly)
- Vulnerability scanning (weekly)
- Security code review
- Infrastructure security assessment
- Compliance audits

### Testing Tools
- OWASP ZAP

- SonarQube

## Backup and Recovery

### Backup Strategy
- Daily incremental backups
- Weekly full backups
- Monthly archival backups
- Off-site storage
- Encrypted backups

### Recovery Procedures
- Point-in-time recovery
- Disaster recovery plan
- Business continuity plan
- Emergency response team

### User Training
- Security awareness
- Phishing prevention
- Password management
- Data handling
- Incident reporting

### Admin Training
